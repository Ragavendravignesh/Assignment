// Line 5 - 6
* First thing to be noted here in this code is the usage of var. var always refer the same value wherver 
it is refered in the class or function. so instead of using var we can use const here. 

// Line 8 - 15
* Second thing instead of using fetch to make the api call. We can use axios, this in turn reduce 
the burden intercepting the request details.

* A log statement has been in order to check the output, but that was not removed. 
It should be removed from the code.

// Line 17 - 21

By default we have already set the value of alerttext to processing. it is not needed to check it again.
Also 'else if' was breaken down into two line which affects the readability of the code. we can modify the same 
in the following way.

Fuel consumed should be greater than 10000 to show the alert message

Code snippet:

    (fuel && ( fuel.litres > 10000 && setAlertText('Need to buy more fuel') ) || setAlertText('All is fine') );


//Line 24
// we can avoid styling the component by inline styling. Also we are using a conditional check it affects the readability of code.
we can rewrite the same by.

<h1 className={getClassName()}>{alertText}</div>

function getClassName() {
    return alertText === 'Need to buy more fuel' && 'error'
}

inside styling:

.error {
    color: 'red';
}
